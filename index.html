            Uhmm, 3 years, we‚Äôve come a long way sam, we really have, i get asked everyday how, why and when what they
            don‚Äôt know is as i‚Äôm as shocked as them. I know i write this shii a lot for ya but i couldn‚Äôt give a shi i‚Äôd
            keep writing them and reminding how special you are to me.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            September 1st, <br><br>
            I remember it like it was yesterday, seeing your face for the first time after the virtual flirting and all
            that, the cloth you wore, the hair you were on just like it was yesterday. It‚Äôs really a special day in my
            life no matter what happens in the future i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm forgetting that day, the day i found the best
            girlfriend ever.
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Sam, <br><br>
            I know you feel like you‚Äôre slowing me down and sometimes i feel like that but then i realize it‚Äôs just my
            mind trying to find impediments to my sitch. I don‚Äôt regret asking you out, i don‚Äôt regret the long distance
            we had, i don‚Äôt regret it samantha, i was never a deep love kinda guy it has always been let‚Äôs just go with
            the vibe then it became different with you, i mean everything became different with you. I mean i got no one
            else in mind as the year goes by we became deeper and deeper, we saw the happy phases we saw the sad phases
            and we went through it, all of these is new to me like really new to me and happy it‚Äôs wii you baby girl
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            Flaws, <br><br>
            I mean we all have our flaws i mean no one‚Äôs perfect, but what makes you perfect is that i try to embrace
            the flaws of course it‚Äôd hurt sometimes still i don‚Äôt see it as a reason to stop loving you. I don‚Äôt wanna
            mention them coz i don‚Äôt like calling someone out coz i don‚Äôt like what they did or act coz you might not
            see anything wrong in it, i got used to you sending me snaps and your day and your outfit, then things have
            been changing and i didn‚Äôt want it to bother me so i stopped viewing your snaps, you know how that‚Äôs how i
            deal with it, same thing i noticed when i came to the salon and you told santos to come coz you weren‚Äôt sure
            i was coming, all these made me feel do you actually love me or love the attention I‚Äôm gonna give, it‚Äôs calm
            tho they‚Äôre just shii i felt and all
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
            What makes you perfect <br><br>
            My perfect girlfriend, I‚Äôve always said there‚Äôs nothing i‚Äôd change about i don‚Äôt even normally want to
            change anything about someone but still won‚Äôt change anything about you.
            I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre growing together i mean it‚Äôs 3 years we have to grow, i don‚Äôt wanna stop at 3 years i still
            want to see where the future takes us, it‚Äôd sound cliche if i say i want to spend my lifetime with you but i
            have i high hopes and also intrigued to see the what it has installed.
            Happy 3 years anniversary my love, cheers to many many many more years my queen‚ù§Ô∏è
