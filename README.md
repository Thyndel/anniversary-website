## 🌹 A Message For You
Samantha,  
3 years feels like a blink, yet it carries a lifetime of love and memories.  
Through the highs and lows, you’ve been my best friend, my peace, my queen.  

This is just a small way to remind you how much you mean to me.  
Cheers to **many more anniversaries** ahead.  

With all my love,  
**Thyndel ❤️**
